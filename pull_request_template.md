## Purpose of this PR



## Checklist:
- [ ] I did not use Excel to open csv files or checked that no side-effects occur (changed values, many new quotation marks, â€¦)
- [ ] I added any renamed piam_variable to [`renamed_piam_variables.csv`](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/blob/master/inst/renamed_piam_variables.csv) to guarantee backwards compatibility.
- [ ] For REMIND variables, I used `|+|` notation consistently. This can be achieved automatically with [`updatePlusUnit()`](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/blob/master/R/updatePlusUnit.R).

It is recommended to have a look at the [tutorial](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/blob/master/tutorial.md) before submission.
