Emissions|CO2|Energy and Industrial Processes;Mt CO2/yr;2;Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use in supply and demand sectors (IPCC category 1A, 1B) and from industrial processes (IPCC categories 1A2, 1A5, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E), including emissions from international bunker fuels. This is the sum of sources and sinks, and includes negative emisisons in these sectors, for instance from bioenergy with CCS (BECCS);For a breakdown of carbon removals, see the 'Carbon Removal|*' variables.;;Emi|CO2|w/ Bunkers|Energy and Industrial Processes;Mt CO2/yr;;reason for manual mapping: default mapping substracts CO2 emissions from Industrial Processes of the CDR sector to correct OAE accounting;R;
Emissions|CH4;Mt CH4/yr;1;Emissions of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere;Net emissions 'Emissions|CO2' = 'Gross Emissions|CO2' + 'Gross Removals|CO2'. For a breakdown of carbon removals, see the 'Carbon Removal|*' variables.;;Emi|CH4;Mt CH4/yr;;reason for manual mapping: default mapping adds extra emissions to Emi CH4;R;

Emissions|CH4|Energy;Mt CH4/yr;1;Emissions of methane (CH4) from energy use, including fugitive emissions from fuels (IPCC category 1A (except manufacturing 1A2 and other unspecified 1A5), 1B), reporting the sum of sources and sinks, including negative emissions from carbon capture and removal using BECCS and other forms of CCS on energy supply and demand for instance for Oil, Gas, and Coal, as well as bio-oil storage and synthetic fuels;For a breakdown of carbon removals, see the 'Carbon Removal|*' variables.;;Emi|CH4|w/ Bunkers|Energy;Mt CH4/yr;;reason for manual mapping: default mapping adds extra emissions to Emi CH4 Energy and uses other variables for mapping;R;
